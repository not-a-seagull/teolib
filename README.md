# teolib

This is a project that I put together when I was first learning to code. The intent with this was to create something similar to [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses), where you can render "windows" and other shapes into a textual environment. However, my first demos of this program failed, and I later abandoned it for other projects.

I made several bad coding practices while making this (for instance, not putting the output directory in a `.gitignore` file). Given the existence of much better programs (like ncurses), I do not plan on improving or adding onto this repo.
